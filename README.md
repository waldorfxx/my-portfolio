Using `face-lib.js`, a real-time facial recognition toolkit which built on top on TensorFlow and implements several CNNs based on javascript to solves facial detection problem on the HTML page. I applied it with the Runner game application which mainly built with C#. Since the purpose of this project is to make this game able to play on an online browser, HTML and CSS are needed as a bridge between those two. The `face-lib.js` was modified as detected only the smile expression to send a score to a game application. The main idea of it is using `68 point face landmarks` to detect landmark positions on the human face.

The first study [*"Enhance Physical and Mental Well-Being of Game Players in an Endless Running Game"*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9015570) is a game demo that aiming to find the possibility to combines physical detection and facial detection with emotion recognition for health well-being according to the WHO organization's issues in 2018 while the trend of game-exercise is raising. According to the first study, it leads to [*"Encourage Players to Smile While Playing Games Bring More Enjoyment"*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9231694) which focused on the improvement of player game experience while mainly focus on developing the game that applied with Facial Detection and Emotion recognition algorithm.

### Artificial Intelligence

* ### Human-like AI
> **Keywords**: Artificial Intelligence | C# 

This project using Quadratic Function to make Artificial Intelligence Agent which can play a game like human. 
The purpose when human watching the gameplay, they cannot knows that it is computer who playing it.
